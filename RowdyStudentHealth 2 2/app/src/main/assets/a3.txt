One of the best ways to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is
by washing your hands with plain soap and water, advises the CDC. Washing hands often with soap and
water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating;
and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing oneâ€™s nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC
recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
